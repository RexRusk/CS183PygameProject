# CS183 Pygame Project

This is a video game programming based on Pygame in Python3.9.2.

It is a 2D Mario platform jumping game, having 3 levels and some block interactions, even with the left-up score counts (all the score are counted correctly). I also improve the game UI with better performance, and you can choose the keyboard or the screen touching to interact the player.

Although it is a group project, I completed this project by myself.
The game is well-designed, especially the UI in the game.
It is open source, but please don't plagiarize without citations.

Before you can run this project, you will need to install the following:

- Python 3.9.2 or Conda virtual environment
- Pygame

<ul>

# Future development

* Add more monsters and effects
* Make the level switch more reasonable but no just go to the right end
* A tutorial
* Flexible to the windows resolution
* Improve the texture
